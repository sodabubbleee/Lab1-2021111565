Being your slave, what should do i the but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend
Nor services to do the for, till you require.
Nor dare do the for I chide the world-without-end hour
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you top,
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour.
